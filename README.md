##Main points
- Networking teams have one of the most important jobs in CIT
 -The Internet is defined as two or more machines connected.
- The Internet is primarily computers connected by tens of thousands of kilometers of fiber optic cable.  
- There is the local area internet network or LAN, and it is a network that is connected to one router.
- Outside the LAN, we have a world-area internet or WAI.
- A Port can be a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application.
- The seven layers model is how a device sends data to the internet.
- Once a device receives a bit stream, the process is reverted.
- IP4 address is displayed in a format consisting of dotted decimals with four numbers.
- An IP address is a 32 number divided into four 8-bit octets.
- The first three numbers are the network address, and the last number is the host address.
- The subnet mask determines whether a host uses a subnet or a remote network.
- A Default Gateway is a router that allows packets of data to another computer in the network.
- The number of subnet addresses in a subnet depends on how the subnet mask is divided by the number of subnets.
- VPC, as name the states, is a virtual private cloud network 
- Amazon has a VPC connection to your AWS account.
- VPC spans all availability zones in an AWS region.
- However, you must only have one subnet per availability zone.
- By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location.
- To create a VPC, you set a range of subnet addresses via a Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
- In VPC, a virtual private gateway is used to connect to a corporate network.
- Amazon VPC uses the IPv4 address as the default.
- An elastic network interface is a virtual network interface that describes the attributes of an IP address.
- A routing table defines how network traffic is routed from a subnet or gateway.
- Network address translation is a process of mapping multiple private IP addresses to a public address.
- A PVN allows a secure correction to a private network.
## Quotes
- “An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. You can associate an Elastic IP address with any instance or network interface in any VPC in your account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your VPC.”
- “A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.”
## New facts
- The system admin can customize the subnet mask. 
- The internet of things
- An 8-bit number can only add to 255.
- However, as with this limit, a 32-bit system can have limited combinations, 4 billion.
- Because of this, We are upgrading from IPv4 to IPv6, a 125 bits system.
- There is the Hexadecimal system.
- A google data center has six layers of physical security.
